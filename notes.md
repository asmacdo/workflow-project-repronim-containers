From the dataset homepage https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004215/versions/2.0.1
	- Initial instinct was to "clone"
	- looking at the clone button though, it provides https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds004215.git
	- this seems odd, githubs not git-annex enabled...
	- Looking at the ds comments it suggested ///openneuro from the datalad superdataset
	- but cloning it anyway includes a datalad sibling s3-PUBLIC!
